-- Introduction to SQL
-- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed to interact with databases.

-- Primary Uses of SQL:
-- - CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete

-- Applications of SQL:
-- SQL is essential in industries where data needs to be stored, accessed, and manipulated, as most data is kept in databases.

-- What is a Database?
-- A database is a system that allows users to store and organize data efficiently.

-- Why Use a Database?
-- Databases are used to store, manipulate, and retrieve data quickly and reliably.

-- Types of Databases:
-- - RDBMS (Relational Database Management System): Data is stored in tables.
--   Examples: MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle

-- - NoSQL: Data is stored as key-value pairs.
--   Examples: MongoDB

-- SQL vs Excel

-- Excel:
-- - Best for small datasets
-- - Ideal for one-time analysis
-- - Quick to create charts/graphs
-- - Suitable for users without database training

-- SQL/Database:
-- - Handles large datasets efficiently
-- - Supports real-time data storage
-- - Easily combines with other datasets
-- - Allows reusable automated steps
-- - Provides safe access and data integrity
-- - Offers deep search capabilities

-- Database Diagrams
-- Creating database diagrams can help visualize the relationships between tables, making it easier to understand and work with the database.
